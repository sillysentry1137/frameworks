# MITRE ATT&CK Resources for Understanding and Use

**MITRE ATT&CK** ("Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge") is a comprehensive framework meant for modeling and understanding adversary behavior. It usually does this by helping to improve detection, response, and defense strategies.

### [Official MITRE ATT&CK Website](https://attack.mitre.org/)

**Overview**: The official site provides access to the full ATT&CK knowledge base - includes techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

####**What you get on the main site**:  
  - Matrices/mapping for different platforms  
  - Searchable techniques and tactics
  - Explanations, use cases, and guides  
Use cases are typically generalized into detection, mitigation, and analysis. This site is great itself, but if you want to take the more configurable approach, consider using external tools.

### [MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)
This is the most commonly used matrix for teaching/introduction to ATT&CK. Focuses specifically on enterprise-level environments, providing nice, explorable yet in-depth looks at the relevant tactics and techniques.
Includes detailed matrices for Windows, Linux, and cloud platforms. Descriptions are provided for a wide range of techniques and how they relate to specific adversary behaviors. Will detail cloud, network, and endpoint-specific techniques.

### [ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/)
Interactive tool developed by MITRE to visualize ATT&CK matrices. Ideal for familiarizing yourself with, and allowing better realization of adversary behavior by mapping threats and planning defense strategies. Allows customizable views w/filters of matrices and exportable configs for threat modeling/analysis. Available via GitHub.

### [The Anatomy of an Att&ck - IBM Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2icKi2q6NS4)
A good introductory video for those who would like to see examples of different parts of ATT&CK in action. Critical topics and actions clearly defined. Available via YouTube.

### [Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Best%20Practices%20for%20MITRE%20ATTCK%20Mapping.pdf)
Document from CISA exploring examples of mapping - goes into specifics quite often, which is great if you're using this as a point of reference for learners who would like to start exploring this in more advanced stages. The examples listed here are great for adherence to what's generally considered "best practice" in most areas of cybersecurity. Document opens as a PDF.
