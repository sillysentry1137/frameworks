# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)

**NIST CSF** is widely regarded as the gold standard for cybersecurity governance and risk management. It provides a recognized set of best practices, guidelines, and standards designed to help organizations manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks. Flexible and scalable, it can be tailored to organizations of any size or sector and is highly recommended by CISA. Many parts of the U.S. government, including federal, state, and local agencies, actively use it to enhance their safety and align with national security priorities.

### [NIST Cybersecurity Framework Official Documentation](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf)

**Overview**: The authoritative resource for understanding NIST CSF, straight from the source. It provides in-depth explanations of the Core, Implementation Tiers, and Profiles, offering a comprehensive view of the framework. Yes, it is somewhat complex. Trust meâ€”it's worth the effort!

#### **What you get in the official documentation**:
- Detailed breakdowns, including Core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
- How/when/why to use Implementation Tiers to assess to improve cybersecurity maturity
- Explanations and insights into creating Profiles tailored to organizational needs and priorities.

NIST CSF offers a common, easily explainable language for communicating cybersecurity concepts by facilitating collaboration across technical and non-technical stakeholders and associates in organizations.
